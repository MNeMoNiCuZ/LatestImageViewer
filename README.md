# LatestImageViewer
A simple image viewer that automatically shows the latest image in a folder.
This software was developed to make it easier to see new images coming in to a folder and always see the latest one.
This is very useful when working with AI image generation as it lets you view the last output automatically.

# Usage
Launch the application and input the folder path to your folder with images in it.
Any new image added to the folder should trigger it to automatically display the new item, **as long as you are currently viewing the newest image in the folder**.

You can navigate to other images using the arrow keys (LEFT/RIGHT), or the scroll wheel.
PGUP/PGDN jumps 10 images, and HOME/END goes to oldest/latest image.

You can also hold down RIGHT MOUSE and move up/down to zoom in, although it's a bit janky and laggy.

ALT + ENTER to go full-screen (it always fullscreens on your primary monitor unfortunately, known bug).
DELETE to delete the image. It should go to your trash, but use at your own risk.

There's a right-click menu for some of these inputs.
